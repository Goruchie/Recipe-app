Recipe.create(name: "Vanilla Cake", preparation_time: "35 minutes", cooking_time: "25 minutes",
description: "This vanilla cake batter is strong enough for shaped cakes,
tiered cakes (see the slight variation in my homemade wedding cake recipe), and holds up beautifully under fondant.
Use this batter for vanilla cupcakes, Bundt cake, or even pi√±ata cake.
It\'s classy enough for a wedding celebration, but unassuming enough for a big family dinner.",
